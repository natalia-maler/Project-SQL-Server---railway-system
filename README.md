Railway system diagram with online ticket booking
Creation of a database on the railway network to handle train schedules, passenger journeys, information about stations and more. The system facilitates ticket booking, train service, ticket cancellation.

Functionalities:
- The system will contain information about trains, such as train name, number of carriages, train type (carrier name). This will create a pool of trains from which we will be able to select available trains to plan a new trip.

- You can create a table - technical details of trains, which stores technical details of each train, such as engine power, manufacturer, year of production. Each train would have exactly one record in this table, which would create a one-to-one relationship.
